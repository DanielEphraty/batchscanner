Batchscanner
===========================================

.. warning::
   Project still under development.

:program:`Batchscanner` is a program to batch-query or batch-configure multiple Siklu radios
via their CLI (SSH) interface.
It operates over a user-defined range of IP addresses and/or networks, executes some action,
and writes the results to csv/txt files.

.. note::
   This program is a personal initiative and contribution. Although it is designed
   for managing radios by `Siklu Communications <https://www.siklu.com>`_, no use
   has been made of any company resources, nor any intellectual proprietary nor
   confidential information.
