# List of IP addresses (and login credentials) for Batchscanner.
# Each line describes either an IP address/range, or login credentials.
# Login credentials
#       are specified as:
#           username = login_username
#           password = login_password
#       and are valid until changed by additional username/password lines.
#       If omitted, the defaults are 'admin'/'admin'
# IP address/range
#       Can be *any number* of the following, each on a new line:
#           A single IP address
#           A range of IP addresses: start and end addresses separated by a hyphen
#           A subnet, with a forward slash denoting the number of subnet bits
#       For example:
#           192.168.0.100
#           192.168.0.115
#           10.11.12.0 - 10.11.12.254
#           10.10.10.0/24
#           192.168.100.0/23
